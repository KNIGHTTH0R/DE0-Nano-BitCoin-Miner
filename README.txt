IMPORTANT You will need to press the KEY-0 pushbutton on the DE0-Nano board to start the miner.
The LEDs then display a binary count (top byte of nonce) to indicate mining in-progress.

A quick note to help you find your way around this stuff ...

Hashers22 - is a port of the Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner to the DE0-Nano, hard coded with
22 sha256_transform modules, giving one full bitcoin hash per 6 clock cycles. It uses the
USB/JTAG driver (scripts\mine.tcl) as described in the original project. I have not incuded
the program and mine scripts as these are available from Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner which
is linked above and should be referred to for operating instructions.

Hashers22_serial - this impliments a custom serial interface instead of the USB/JTAG driver
used above. It requires a Raspberry pi single-board computer (since that's what I had to hand)
and a homebrew interface board. It should not be too difficult to port it to some other
configuration, though beware the voltage limits of the DE0-Nano I/O (Do NOT connect it directly
to a standard PC RS232 serial port as you will destroy the DE0-Nano board.)

serial_solo - the raspberry pi mining driver written in C (rather crude and basic).

FpgaminerOnPi.txt - describes how to setup the serial interface on the pi.

The PLL clock speed is set by the parameter (Verilog macro) SPEED_MHZ in units of 10MHz,
eg SPEED_MHZ=4 runs at 40MHz, which is the default setting. This gives 6.67MHash/s throughput.
This is the fastest that I recommend running an unmodified DE0-Nano. You may clock faster at
your own risk, but you should monitor the temperature of the the onboard regulator chips as
these will get VERY hot unless additional cooling is applied (eg fan blown air). The fpga
chip may also need cooling. BEWARE, you risk destroying your board due to overheating if you
increase SPEED_MHZ, and the actual speed in MHz is 10 times the value set for SPEED_MHZ.

Current draw is approx 10mA per MHz (eg 40MHz will draw approx 400mA). Beware that a typical
USB port may only be able to supply 500mA so a 5.0 Volt external power supply connected to
the DE0-Nano white PSU header (JP4) is advised if overclocking. I have not myself run this
configuration any faster than 80MHz (SPEED_MHZ=8), and fan cooling was essential.

After programming, the miner starts up in a halted state (it does NOT mine in this state).
Pressing the KEY0 pushbutton on the DE0-Nano board will start the miner (and reset the nonce).
Pressing KEY1 will halt it. This allows some control of power and thermal management as the
halted state draws considerably less current from the power supply. This was of importance
when extreme overclocking was applied to the Hashers22_serial version as follows.

I have run the Hashers22_serial version at up to 140Mhz (SPEED_MHZ=14) using an external 3.3
Volt supply (the USB cable must be disconnected after programming and prior to starting the
miner else it will attempt to draw approx 1.5amps from the USB port which may cause damage).
Cooling is essential as the regulators run VERY hot. I also heatsinked the fpga chip.

I have also run at 170MHz (SPEED_MHZ=17) using a custom hardwired 1.2 volt core supply which
gave my maximum achived throughput of 28.3 MHash/s. Attempting to run at 180MHz gave bad hash
results, so this is the limit. Note that this draws 1.7amps which is outside the spec of the
DE0-Nano regulators, hence the custom power supply hack.

The latter two extreme overclocking results are only mentioned since you may come across
comments to this effect on the bitcontalk blog linked above. I do NOT recommend you attempt
either of these things as there is a high risk of destroying your DE0-Nano board and possibly
the USB host computer as well. Don't go blaming me, you have been warned.
